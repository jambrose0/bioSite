            <p>Mary Jo Ambrose was born and raised in Winston-Salem, NC. As Jerry Breiner said “The Best Things Come in Twos,” being born with a  twin, Jeanette, Mary Jo also has a younger sister Natalie.
                 Her family heavily emphasized community events such as the church’s pumpkin farm during the fall and extensive travel helped foster a sense of adventure and curiosity.
                  During middle school and high school she was able to attend her city’s International Baccalaureate program for advanced learning which helped pave her way to higher learning at Wake Forest University.
                   Graduating with a Bachelor’s in Elementary Education Mary Jo has taught both in traditional classrooms and non-traditional classrooms such as in outdoor education. After teaching in a traditional classroom for a couple of years, Mary Jo went to California and taught at an outdoor education center in the San Bernadino mountains where she met her husband. 
                   After a year of outdoor education, Mary Jo returned to the Blue Ridge mountains in North Carolina and began teaching both 4th grade and the STEM classes for the elementary wing of her school.
                    As with all things, COVID in 2020 had a major impact on Mary Jo. Looking for new opportunities, Mary Jo made two big new career changes. 
                    Returning for her Master’s in curriculum development and in 2023 she moved from the traditional classroom to working as an instructional coach for a large curriculum company.
                     A new focus of assisting teachers learn new curriculum and better understand the teaching process, Mary Jo is excited to see what the future holds!
